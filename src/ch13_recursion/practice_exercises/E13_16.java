/**
 *
 * Difficulty: Hard
 * 
 * Prompt:
 * Recursively genereate all ways in which an array list can be split up into a sequence of nonempty sublists. For example, if
 * you are given the array list [1, 7, 2, 9], return the following lists of lists:
 *
 *	[[1], [7], [2], [9]],
 *	[[1, 7], [2],[9]],
 *	[[1], [7, 2], [9]],
 *	[[1, 7, 2], [9]],
 *	[[1], [7], [2, 9]],
 *	[[1, 7], [2, 9]],
 *	[],
 *	[[1, 7, 2, 9]]
 *	
 * Hint: First generate all sublists of the list with the last element removed. The last element can either be the subsequence of
 * length 1, or it can be added to the last subsequnce.
