••• Science P1.11 Cameras today can correct “red eye” problems
 * caused when the photo flash makes eyes look red.
 * Write pseudocode for an algorithm that can detect red eyes. Your input is a pattern
 * of colors, such as that at right.
 * You are given the number of rows and columns. For any row or column number,
 * you can query the color, which will be red, black, or something else. If you find that
 * the center of the black pixels coincides with the center of the red pixels, you have
 * found a red eye, and your output should be “yes”. Otherwise, your output is “no”.
