 *      public static double slope(Point2D.Double p, Point2D.Double q)
 *
 * that compute the angle between the x-axis and the line joining two points, measured in degrees, and the slope of that line. Add the methods to the class Geometry. Supply suitable preconditions. Why does it make sense to use a static method in this case?
