/**
 * ••• P1.8 Consider a robot that has been placed in a maze. The right-hand rule tells you how
 * to escape from a maze: Always have the right hand next to a wall, and eventually you
 * will find an exit. The robot can:
 * • Move forward by one unit.
 * • Turn left or right.
 * • Sense what is in front of it: a wall, an exit, or neither.
 * Write an algorithm that lets the robot escape the maze. You
 * may assume that there is an exit that is reachable by the
 * right-hand rule. Your challenge is to deal with situations in
 * which the path turns. The robot can’t see turns. It can only
 * see what is directly in front of it.
