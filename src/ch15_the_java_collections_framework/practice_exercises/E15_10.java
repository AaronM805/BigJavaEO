/**
 * A homeowner rents out parking spaces in a driveway during special events. The driveway is a “last-in, first-out” stack. Of
 * course, when a car owner retrieves a vehicle that wasn’t the last one in, the cars blocking it must temporarily move to the
 * street so that the requested vehicle can leave. Write a program that models this behavior, using one stack for the driveway
 * and one stack for the street. Use integers as license plate numbers. Positive numbers add a car, negative numbers remove a
 * car, zero stops the simulation. Print out the stack after each operation is complete.
