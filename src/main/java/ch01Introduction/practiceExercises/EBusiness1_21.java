 * • Business E1.21 To speak more than one language is a valuable
 * skill in the labor market today. One of the basic
 * skills is learning to greet people. Write a program
 * that prints a two-column list with the greeting
 *
 * phrases shown in the table. In the first col-
 * umn, print the phrase in English, in the second
 *
 * column, print the phrase in a language of your
 * choice. If you don’t speak a language other than
 * English, use an online translator or ask a friend.
