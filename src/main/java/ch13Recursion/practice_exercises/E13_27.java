 * The recursive compuation of Fibonacci numbers can be speeded up significantly by keeping track of the values that have already
 * been computed. Provided an implmenetaion of the fib method that uses this strategy. Whenever you return a new values, also
 * strore it in an auxiliary array. However, before embarking on  computation, conculte the array to find whetehr the result has
 * already bee ncomptued. Compare the running time of your imporved implemenetaion with that o the original recursive
 * implmeentation and the loop implementation.
