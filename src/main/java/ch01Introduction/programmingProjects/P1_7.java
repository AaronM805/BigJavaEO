 * Consider a robot that is placed in a room. The robot can:
 *
 * • Move forward by one unit.
 * • Turn left or right.
 * • Sense what is in front of it: a wall, a window, or neither.
 *
 * Write an algorithm that enables the robot, placed anywhere in the room, to count the number of windows. For example,
 * in the room at right, the robot (marked as R) should find that it has two windows.
