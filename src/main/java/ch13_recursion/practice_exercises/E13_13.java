 * Difficulty: Medium
 * 
 * Prompt:
 * The following method was known to the ancient Greeks for computing square roots. Given a value x > 0 and a guess g for the
 * square root, a better guess is (g + x/g) / 2. Wirte a recursive helper method
 *
 *	public satic squareRootGuess(double x, double g)
 *
 * If g2 is approximately equal to x, return g, otherwise, return squareRootGuess with the better guess. Then write a method
 *
 *	public static squareRoot(double x)
 *
 * that uses the helper method.
