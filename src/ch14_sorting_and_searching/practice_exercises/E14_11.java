 * Implement the algorithm described in Section 14.7.4, but only remember the value with the highest frequency so far:
 *   
 *  int mostFrequent = 0;
 *  int highestFrequency = -1;
 *  for int(i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
 *      Count how often a[i] occurs in a[i+1] â€¦ a[a.length - 1]
 *      if it occurs more often than highestFrequency
 *          highestFrequency = that count
 *          mostFrequent = a[i]
