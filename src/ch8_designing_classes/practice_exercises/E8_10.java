 * Difficulty: Hard
 * Prompt:
 * Write methods
 *      public static double perimeter(Ellipse2D.Double e)
 *      public static double area(Ellipse2D.Double e)
 *
 * that compute the area and the perimeter of the ellipse e. Add these methods to a class Geometry. The challenging part of this assignment is to find and implement an accurate formula for the perimeter. Why does it make sense to use a static method in this case?
